# Fastfood-Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of fast food nutritional data collected from various restaurant chains. The aim is to derive insights into the nutritional content and pricing trends of food items across different restaurants to support health-conscious consumer choices and strategic planning for food service providers.
Using a structured dataset containing information such as calories, fat content, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and price per item, we developed a detailed interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key nutritional metrics across restaurants and food categories.

Comparative Restaurant Analysis: Evaluates average calories, fat, and price across different fast food chains.

Nutrient-Wise Breakdown: Provides visual insight into the composition of key nutrients like total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and protein per item.

Calorie from Fat Analysis: Assesses the proportion of calories derived from fat to identify high-fat food items.

Health Indicator Metrics: Highlights sodium and cholesterol-heavy items, aiding dietary decision-making.

Filter and Drill-down Functionality: Enables dynamic filtering by restaurant or food item for detailed exploration.

Tools Used:
Power BI for dashboard development and data visualization.

MySQL/PHPMyAdmin for data extraction from the provided database.

Excel for initial data cleaning and formatting.
